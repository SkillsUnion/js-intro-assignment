# JavaScript Introduction: Assignment

This assignement will be done entirely in CodeSandox - we'll give you a starting sandbox to fork & work in.

## Problems

### 1: Data Types

What are the return values for each of the below code snippets? After coming up with each answer, test it out in the browser console.

#### Structure

This assignement repository contains some preexisting tests for you to fix. On CodeSandbox you'll have them run automatically - the goal is to have all of them green!


To have them work on your own machine, first run:

```bash
   yarn install
```

You can then run the test with just

```bash
   yarn test
```

#### Part 1: Types

We're going to look at datatypes.

Open [types.test.js](src/types.test.js) and try to fix all the tests!


#### Part 2: Conversions

Open [conversions.test.js](src/conversions.test.js) and try to fix all the tests!

What's going on here? What "rules," if any, can we guess from testing these examples?

### 2: Temperature Converter

Create a program that can convert a temperature from Celsius to in Fahrenheit or Kelvin.

#### Setup

1. Open the 3.1_temperature.js file
1. Check the two lines where we defined the "kelvin" & "farheneit"  variables
1. Update those two so that the test run successfully

For this one you don't need to change the test code - just those two lines.
Check that all the tests are passing!
