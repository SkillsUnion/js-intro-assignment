# JavaScript Introdcution: Assignment

## Problems

### 1: Data Types

What are the return values for each of the below code snippets? After coming up with each answer, test it out in the browser console.

#### Structure

This assignement repository contains some preexisting tests for you to fix. On CodeSandbox you'll have them run automatically - the goal is to have all of them green!


To have them work on your own machine, first run:

```bash
   yarn install
```

You can then run the test with just

```bash
   yarn test
```

#### Part 1:

We're going to look at datatypes.

Open [types.test.js](src/types.test.js) and try to fix all the tests!


#### Part 2:

What's going on here? What "rules," if any, can we guess from testing these examples?

```js
"hamburger" + "s";
// Your Answer

"hamburgers" - "s";
// Your Answer

"4" + "2"
// Your Answer

"4" - "2";
// Your Answer

"johnny" + 5;
// Your Answer

"johnny" - 5;
// Your Answer

99 * "baloons";
// Your Answer

```

### 2: Temperature Converter

Create a program that can convert a temperature in Fahrenheit, Celsius, or Kelvin to the other two units.

#### Setup

1. Under the `src` directory, create a file named `index.html`
1. Under the `src` directory, create a file named `script.js`
1. Make sure to link the `script.js` file with the `index.html` file

#### Instructions

1. Define a variable named `celsius`
1. Store the temperature you get from the user into the `celsius` variable
1. Using the [conversion formula](http://www.csgnetwork.com/temp2conv.html), write JavaScript code that converts `Celsius` to its equivalent `Fahrenheit` and `Kelvin` values

    Example:

    ```
    0C => 32F
    0C => 273.15K
    ```
1. Use `console.log` to print the starting and converted temperature
1. Repeat steps 1-4 for `Fahrenheit` and `Kelvin` temperatures
1. Test your program by opening the `index.html` file in your browser

**Example:**

```js
// Starting temperature
const celsius = ...; // Add some code to get the user input

// Conversion Code
const celsiusToFahrenheit = ...;
const celsiusToKelvin = ...;

// Print the results to the browser console
console.log(`Celsius: #{...}`);
console.log(`Fahrenheit: #{...}`);
console.log(`Kelvin: #{...}`);
```

The browser will print something like this example in the console:

```
Celsius: STARTING_TEMP C
Fahrenheit: CONVERTED_TEMP F
Kelvin: CONVERTED_TEMP K
```
